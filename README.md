TradingView, one of the largest investing communities on the web, announced the close of a $40M Series B financing in a round led by Insight Venture Partners, with participation from Jump Capital and DRW Venture Capital. TradingView will use the capital to expand its valuable software product suite and to continue its rapid international growth.

TradingView is one of the world's largest social networks for retail traders and investors, and combines web-based charting, analytics, and a trading platform with social features for users to communicate. Founded in 2011, TradingView went through TechStars Chicago in 2013 and secured $3.7M in financing previously from Irish Angels, TechStars, iTech Capital, and a number of prominent angel investors.

"At TradingView we strive to build the biggest and best community of traders and give them the most powerful tools - immersive charting, easy sharing of trading ideas, instant data access from around the world, and trading through brokers they trust. It's a one-stop-shop for traders and we are extremely excited to partner with Insight Venture Partners, Jump, and DRW VC in this next stage of growth. Individually and together they bring an enormous amount of expertise and resources to the table," said Denis Globa, co-founder and CEO.

## Business Activities

TradingView is a useful tool for both novice and experienced traders. It’s extremely simple to use for those getting started in technical analysis, and at the same time, it includes most indicators and technical analysis tools an experienced trader needs.

 - CHARTING

   There is a lot to unpack here. The default graph is a candles’ graph. It comes with the trading volume at the bottom by default, though you can add more indicators to it. The free plan only allows one indicator, but with the other plans, you can add more.

   At the top, we can pick the type of graph we want to see, the time intervals, indicators, alerts, and financial data. These are the basic tools for us to analyze the graph. Furthermore, I would like to highlight their indicators’ functionality, though. Besides the dozens of built-in indicators, you can also access indicators created by the community, and see the underlying scripts. This community aspect is a great way to learn how other more experienced traders have created their indicators, and what they are good for.

   On the left-hand side are tools you can use to enhance a graph with annotations. That could be a trend line, a text note, a Fibonacci retracement, etc. There are dozens of useful annotations you can use, depending on how familiar you are with those.

   On the right-hand side, we can build and access a watch list of assets, set up alerts, see the raw data, and community features such as ideas shared by others, public and private chats, etc. There is also real-time news on each of the selected tickers, and a preview of its fundamentals and technical analysis.

   Finally, at the bottom, we can access the stock screener, test trading strategies and connect our broker account with TradingView, so that we can buy/sell assets from it.


- SCREENERS
  
  TradingView’s screener is, in my opinion, a very middle-of-the-road scanner. It shines where TradingView shines, which is ease of use and a satisfying user interface, but it lacks in customization. There is a limited amount of screening options, and many indicators/fundamental pieces of data included in the TradingView infrastructure are not available for use in the screener. Additionally, the indicators that are included, cannot be manipulated. For example, if you have a strategy using the 90 period EMA and the 5 period Average Directional Index, you would not be able to scan for setups in TradingView, instead, you would have to use the closest options which are the 14 period ADX and 100 period EMA.

  Screeners also include TradingView’s rating, which varies from strong sell to strong buy. Those ratings are measured based on a number of technical indicators and are very prominent in the technical details’ section of individual stocks. More on this in the technical analysis’ section below. It’s possible to either use their table interface or alternatively download the resulting screener data as a CSV.

- ALERTS

   TradingView provide server-side alerts. With this feature, we can set up price alerts on individual assets and get notified on any of their platforms when the current price hits that defined amount.

     Each alert is highly configurable

  - setup on-off alerts or recurring ones;
  - choose a specific price or a % move;
  - set up a webhook and have an external application act on it too, but that might require some development effort.

- COMMUNITY

  The best way to improve is by learning with others. TradingView allows us to do that via their Ideas feature. It is a way for us to share our assumptions with other traders, and get feedback from them. We can also explore literally thousands of ideas from other traders and investors, and learn from them. If their ideas are consistently playing out as they expect, you got yourself a mentor you can learn from.

  Besides technical analysis, ideas in TradingView can be used for other purposes. It’s possible to create ideas around risk management, trading plans, short/long positions, and so on. Each asset has top authors and top ideas associated with them, which makes it easier to choose whom to follow for the best content.


  Despite this being a great tool, it has its drawbacks as well. On one hand, it’s great to have access to millions of other traders and investors and learn from their ideas and chats. But on the other hand, the curation is not quite up-to-scratch, meaning you’ll find a few trolls along the way.



- SCRIPTING

  Pine Script is TradingView’s proprietary scripting language which is surprisingly easy to learn and apply quickly, even for non-coders. With it you can backtest strategies, and if your broker is available, trade them live. For example, you can tell Pine Script to buy everytime the 50 day SMA crosses above the 200 day SMA, and flatten your position when the inverse happens, with a rule against shorting, and see the results on any asset. Of course, much more complex strategies can be tested and coded.

   In Pine script, you will either be creating an indicator or a strategy.


- MARKETS

   With TradingView, we have access to a broad set of market data on stocks, futures, commodities, forex, CFDs, and cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. Most of the major indices are covered and there are over 50+ exchanges and data feeds available for us to slice into custom time intervals as needed. On top of that, TradingView also exposes fundamental and economic data, which is quite useful to investors.

- FUNDAMENTALS
  
   Even though TradingView is more geared towards technical analysis, it also includes a number of features and data on company fundamentals.

   Their data enables insights into how companies are doing beyond just their stock price.

   It is also possible to plot fundamental data on any chart, which allows investors to chart relevant financial data against stock prices and do their analysis. In practical terms, that means it’s possible to see, in a chart, the correlation between metrics like revenue and stock price



- INDICATORS

  TradingView offers a wide library of technical indicators that is routinely being added to and updated. What I like best about TradingView’s indicators more has to do with the platform design itself. While most charting packages have a huge drop-down menu with arbitrary folders full of indicators, TradingView simply has an “indicators” button that brings up a pop-up dialog, allowing you to browse through TradingView’s library of indicators, as well as community produced indicators.
